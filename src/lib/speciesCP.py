"""speciesCP's functions create new scores for the 5 types (species) of counterpoint"""

"""for second- through fifth-species, we have 3 options:
1) alter finalMTX's shape to XXx12x3 (after it finishes writing it as 16x12x3)
   then send the new matrix to matrixToLily (matrixToLily already uses a while
   loop exactly for this)
   NOTE: make sure to add measure numbers (last column) to the new notes for the
       while loop to work!
   NOTE: need to add if statements to beginning and end of the while loops for
       voice==2 (or voice==3 in 4-part harmony...) to set/reset j for each of the
       different species
   PROBLEM: fifth-species is a problem because we don't know the size of the matrix...
   NOTE: now that we converted to numpy struct matrices, we can use np.concatenate()
2) or partition, add to, and concatenate matrixToLily's finalString
   PROBLEM: we know indexes for the partitions in C major, but what if there are accidentals?
3) or use regex on the .ly file (easy-ish since each .ly is almost exactly the same)
   then add the new notes to the soprano lines in the file
   PROBLEM: none, everyone loves regex. right, guys? ...guys?

going with option #1 now that we can easily adjust the matrix for an unknown number of notes"""
